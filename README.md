# Welcome to the BASIC Engine Wiki!
This is the wiki for the [BASIC Engine](https://basicengine.org) Project.

**BASIC Engine** is a firmware for very low-cost single-board computers with great 2D color graphics and sound capabilities similar to **early to mid-1990s** computers and video game consoles. It can be used on **widely available and Orange Pi single-board computers** (as well as most other devices built around an Allwinner H3 or H2+ chip) and runs from an SD card.

For more information, just go to the [Home Page of the wiki](https://github.com/uli/basicengine-wiki/wiki).
Or check the [project's site](https://basicengine.org).

Cheers!
